In this step you will:

* Enter the amount of OCEAN tokens that you are going to lock up
* Select a Lock End Date indicating how many weeks you’re going to lock up your OCEAN tokens. As the Lock End Date goes farther into the future, your Lock Multiplier increases. Selecting a 4 year Lock End Date gives you the maximum lock multiplier of 1 veOCEAN per 1 OCEAN locked.
* Click on the checkbox to agree to the disclaimer.
* Click the pink “Approve # OCEAN” button
* Accept the transaction in your wallet.
* Click the “Create Lock” button.
* Accept the transaction in your wallet.

Congratulations! You have now locked your OCEAN tokens for veOCEAN tokens.
