From startups to full enterprises, we have so many partners and collaborators using Ocean tech. Curious who's working with Ocean tools? Check out our up-to-date list of our partners and collaborators on the [Collaborators page ](https://oceanprotocol.com/collaborators)of our website.

### Get a "degree" in Ocean Protocol knowledge

Our [Ocean Academy](https://oceanacademy.io/) program is a great way to learn more about Ocean Protocol beyond our website, [oceanprotocol.com](https://www.oceanprotocol.com), and our docs, [docs.oceanprotocol.com](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com). The Academy helps you to get up to speed on all things that Ocean can do, setting you up for success using Ocean Protocol tech to build the "next big thing" in Web3 data sharing.
