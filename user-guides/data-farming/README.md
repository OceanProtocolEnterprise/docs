# Welcome to Data Farming

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/gif/farming.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Data Farming is the core incentive system inside of Ocean Protocol. It offers different ways for participants to help the protocol grow and succeed.

It's broken down into 2 reward streams:
1. Passive Rewards
2. Active Rewards

As the name suggests, users need to do very little to earn Passive Rewards and the program is aimed to onboard as many people as possible to help drive liquidity and conviction into the protocol.

Active Rewards is an evolving incentive program that offers different venues for contributors to curate markets, create algorithms, and active do work to imporve the protocol.

All streams operate permissionlessly and anyone is welcomed to participate.

## Passive Rewards stream

Passive Rewards is the first of the main streams within Data Farming.

Passive Rewards offers a defined amount of rewards for each round that is divided amongst veOCEAN holders based on how much they hold.

The primary objective of the Passive Rewards stream is to provide a low-friction, high-accessibility way for anyone that is holding OCEAN to participate and help the protocol grow.

It is by-design, without the need for anyone to put in any significant effort. You simply need to lock your tokens for a period of time.

## Active Rewards stream & substreams

Active Rewards is the second of the main streams within Data Farming.

Active Rewards offers a defined amount of rewards for each round and is further divided into multiple substreams.

The primary objective of these substreams is to provide users with various opportunities to actively engage in Data Farming. This approach allows users with different skills and interests to collaborate and contribute their unique abilities towards achieving the core values of Ocean Protocol.

Let's review the Active Reward substreams now to learn more about them, and help you get started with contributing to Ocean Protocol and earning rewards.

### Volume DF Substream

Volume DF is the bread and butter of the Data Farming incentive program and rewards OCEAN to publishers and curators that help maintain quality assets in the Ocean ecosystem.  

If you have locked your OCEAN tokens in exchange for veOCEAN, this is the ideal opportunity for you to utilize those veOCEAN tokens and earn a portion of active rewards in addition to passive rewards.

By allocating your veOCEAN power to high-quality datasets, you can assist Ocean in curating datasets. Moreover, through allocation, you will also receive a portion of the revenue generated by the dataset consumption.

Allocation Power can also be earned via delegation. The Data Farming dApp [Delegate Page](https://df.oceandao.org/delegate) lets you easily manage simple delegations that use the 100% of the current veOCEAN and the LockEnd time to set the delegation.

For more information on how to get started and detailed instructions, please refer to the [Volume DF](how-to-farm-volumedf.md) section.

### Challenge DF Substream

If you are a data scientist and enjoy tackling challenging problems, this is the perfect place for you. Challenge DF provides a weekly competition where you can test your skills in predicting the price of Ethereum. Rise against other participants to earn a place on the podium and receive a share of the available rewards.

This opportunity allows you to explore the capabilities offered by Ocean Protocol and gain valuable exposure. As your models and skills improve, you can publish your models on the main network and begin monetizing your work.
