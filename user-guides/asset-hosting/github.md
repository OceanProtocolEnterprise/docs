# Github

**Github**

GitHub can be used to host and share files. This allows you to easily share and collaborate on files, track changes using commits, and keep a history of updates. GitHub's hosting capabilities enable you make your content accessible on the web.

**Prerequisite**

Create an account on [Github](https://github.com/). Users might also be asked to provide details and billing addresses that are out of this tutorial's scope.

**Step 1 - Create a new repository on GitHub or navigate to an existing repository where you want to host your files.**

**Fill in the details. Make sure your Repo is publicly accessible**

**Step 2 - Upload a file**

**Go to your Repo in Github and above the list of files, select the Add file dropdown menu and click Upload files. Alternatively you can use version control to push your file to the Repo.**

**To select the files you want to upload, drag and drop the file or folder, or click choose your files.**

**In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message.**

**Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.**

**Step 3 - Get the Raw version of your file**

**To use your file on the Market you need to use the raw url of the asset. Also, make sure your Repo is publicly accessible to allow the market to use that file.**&#x20;

**Open the File and click on "Raw"**
