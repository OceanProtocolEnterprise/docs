The bread and butter of the Data Farming dApp is incentivizing OCEAN rewards for curating valuable assets on the Ocean Market. The way that users curate assets is by **allocating veOCEAN** to them using the Data Farming dApp. We'll show you how!

#### Step 1 - Navigate to the Data Farming dApp

* Go to https://df.oceandao.org

#### Step 2 - Connect your wallet

* Connect your wallet to the Data Farming dApp using the Ethereum network (mainnet)

#### Step 3 - Click on the Farms tab in the top menu

#### Step 4 - Select the assets on the Ocean Market which you would like to allocate to by toggling the percentage allocation at the end of the row

* On the rightmost column, toggle the percentage of your total veOCEAN that you wish to allocate to each asset of your choice. You will **get a portion of the sales** of each asset that you allocate to!
* Note that if you allocate to an asset which YOU published, then you will **get 2x the rewards** of any sales. The rows for assets that you publish will appear cream colored.

#### Step 5 - Click the Update Allocations button

* Sign the transactions with your wallet & pay the gas fees

That's it! You've successfully allocated (aka "voted on") your favorite assets on the Ocean Market using your veOCEAN tokens and are generating active rewards yield. Now, just wait until next Thursday to see if you can [claim any OCEAN rewards](claim-ocean-rewards.md) on the Active Rewards section of the [Rewards page](https://df.oceandao.org/rewards) for your portion of the assets' sales. Remember that your first time claiming rewards will require at least one week, but not more than 2 weeks of wait!
