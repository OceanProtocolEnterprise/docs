The bread and butter of the Data Farming dApp is incentivizing OCEAN rewards for curating high quality datasets and algorithms on the Ocean Market. The way that users curate high quality assets on the Ocean Market is by allocating veOCEAN to them using the Data Farming dApp. We'll show you how!

#### Step 1 - Navigate to the Data Farming dApp

* Go to https://df.oceandao.org

#### Step 2 - Connect your wallet

* Connect your wallet to the Data Farming dApp using the Ethereum network (mainnet)

#### Step 3 - Click on the Farms tab in the top menu

#### Step 4 - Select the assets on the Ocean Market which you would like to allocate to by toggling the percentage allocation at the end of the row

* On the rightmost column, toggle the percentage of your total veOCEAN that you wish to allocate to each asset of your choice. You will **get a portion of the sales** of each asset that you allocate to!
* Note that if you allocate to an asset which YOU published, then you will **get 2x the rewards** of any sales. The rows for assets that you publish will appear cream colored.
