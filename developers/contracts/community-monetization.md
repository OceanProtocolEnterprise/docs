# Community monetization

**Ocean V4 provides more upside for marketplace operators, and makes space for a market of third-party Providers.**

Ocean V3 smart contracts enabled marketplace operators to collect a fee in just one place: consume. The value was hardcoded to 0.1% which was a good start, but it limited the upside.

Ocean V4 provides more upside for marketplace operators. First, **V4 smart contracts enable marketplace operators to collect a fee not only in consume, but also in fixed-rate exchange**. Second, the marketplace operator sets the fee value.

Furthermore, **Ocean V4 enables third-party Providers to provide compute, for a fee**. This enables a marketplace of Providers to emerge. This will work for centralized trusted providers (that the data publisher and consume must trust), but also trustless providers (via decentralization or other privacy-preserving mechanisms).

We’re always looking to give back to the Ocean community and collecting fees is an important part of that. As mentioned above, the Ocean Protocol Foundation retains the ability to implement community fees on both data consumption and datatoken swaps. The tokens that we receive will either be burned or invested in the community via projects that they are building. These investments will take place either through Ocean DAO, Ocean Shipyard, or Ocean Ventures.

Additionally, we will also be placing an additional 0.1% fee on projects that aren’t using either the Ocean token or H2O. We want to support marketplaces that use other tokens but we also recognise that they don’t bring the same wider benefit to the Ocean community, so we feel this small additional fee is proportionate. This fee is set at the contract level so you can be sure that it won’t increase in future.

Our intentions with all of these updates are to ensure that your project is able to become self-sufficient and profitable in the long run (if that’s your aim). We love projects that are built on top of Ocean and we want to ensure that you are able to generate enough income to keep your project running well into the future.

With this in mind, we have aimed to deliver improvements for you irrespective of the type of project you are running:

* If you’re selling data you can benefit from Data NFTs. This means you can sell your IP (or part of it) and benefit from all the new roles when managing your project with others.
* If you’re running your own data marketplace you now have so many more options on how to raise revenue and charge your customers. And the fees can still apply if the asset is bought in a marketplace other than your own!
* For the first time, you can now also create profit for yourself by running your own provider. This also means that you can charge for compute resources
