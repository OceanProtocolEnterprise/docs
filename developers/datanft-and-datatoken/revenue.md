# Revenue

### Revenue

By default revenue is sent to the owner of the data NFT and this automatically updates when the data NFT is sent to a new owner. Owning a data NFT therefore has an explicit value - the revenue stream associated with selling the digital asset.

In some situations, you may want the revenue to be sent to another account rather than the owner. This can be done by setting a new **payment collector**. Changing the payment collector can be particularly useful when the data NFT is owned by an organization or enterprise, rather than an individual.

In order to set a new payment collector, you need to visit the asset detail page and then click on “Edit Asset” and then scroll down to the field call “Payment Collector Address”. Add the new Ethereum address in this field and then click “Submit“. Finally, you will then need to sign two transactions to finalize the update.
