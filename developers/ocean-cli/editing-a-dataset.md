# Editting a dataset

To make modifications to a dataset, you can follow the steps outlined in the previous section titled [getting asset DDO](./getting-asset-ddo.md). After obtaining the asset's DDO and saving it as a JSON file, you can proceed to edit the metadata as needed. Once you've made the necessary changes, you can utilize the following command to apply the updated metadata:

```bash
npm run cli editAsset 'DATASET_DID' 'PATH_TO_UPDATED_FILE`

```
