# Consuming an asset

The process of consuming an asset is remarkably straightforward. To achieve this, you only need to execute a single command: <code>npm run cli download 'assetDID' 'download-location-path'</code>

In this command, replace 'assetDID' with the specific DID of the asset you want to consume, and 'download-location-path' with the desired path where you wish to store the downloaded asset content

Once executed, this command seamlessly orchestrates both the ordering of datatoken and the subsequent download operation. The asset's content will be automatically retrieved and saved at the specified location, simplifying the consumption process for users.
