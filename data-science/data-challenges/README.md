# Data Challenges

Data challenges present an exciting opportunity for data scientists to hone their skills, and actual business problems, and earn some income along the way. These operate as data science competitions where participants are tasked with solving a business problem. Data challenges can have several different types of formats, topics, and sponsors. One of the main advantages of these data challenges is that users retain ownership and the ability to further monetize their work outside of the competition. Active and past data challenges can be found on the Ocean Protocol site [here](https://oceanprotocol.com/challengeshttps://oceanprotocol.com/challenges).
