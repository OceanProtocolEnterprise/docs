### What is an Ocean Protocol data challenge?

Ocean Protocol's data challenges are open competitions where participants must solve a real business problem using data science or machine learning skills. Some challenges are designed for data exploration, analysis, and reporting, while others require developing machine learning models. Thus, data challenges have different types of formats, topics, and sponsors. One of the main advantages of these data challenges is that users retain ownership of their IP and the ability to further monetize their work outside of the competition.

### Where can I find the data challenges?

Discover our open challenges [here](https://oceanprotocol.com/challengeshttps://oceanprotocol.com/challenges).

### What is the typical flow for a data challenge?

1. On Ocean Market, a dataset (or several) is published along with its description and schema. The dataset will either be provided by the data challenge sponsor partner or by OPF ourselves.
2. Participants should download the dataset(s), or a sample if it the data is private. This will allow them to perform exploratory analysis to understand the dataset
3. Based on the data challenge, there are several different ways participants may be tasked with entering the competition, One way is to build a report that combines data visualization and written explanations so that business stakeholders can gain actionable insights into the data. Another way is participants may be tasked with building a machine-learning model to predict a specific target value.&#x20;
4. Users will typically submit directly with Ocean technologies. They can post their reports or algorithms onto the Ocean Market. Those that produce strong submissions can monetize their work by using Oceanâ€™s Compute-to-Data engine so that the model can be run by others in the future for a price.
