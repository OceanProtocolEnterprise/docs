# Data Engineers

Data engineers play a pivotal role in driving data value creation. If you're a developer looking to build useful dashboards or cutting-edge machine-learning models, you understand the importance of having access to well-curated data. That's where our team of friendly and skilled data engineers comes in!

Data engineers specialize in creating robust data pipelines that enable seamless data ingestion from diverse source systems. The expertise lies in conducting essential transformations to ensure data cleanliness and aggregation, ultimately making the data readily available for downstream use cases. With data engineer support, data scientists can focus on unleashing their creativity and innovation, knowing that the data they need is reliably curated and accessible.

There are numerous types of data that data engineers can contribute to the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.

1. Government Open Data: Governments serve as a rich and reliable source of data. However, this data often lacks proper documentation or poses challenges for data scientists to work with effectively. Our team excels at establishing robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines that enhance accessibility to government open data. This way, you can tap into this wealth of information without unnecessary hurdles.
2. Public APIs: A wide range of freely available public APIs covers various data verticals. Leveraging these APIs, our data engineers construct pipelines that enable efficient access and utilization of the data. We'll ensure that you have the necessary tools to harness the potential of these APIs, saving you valuable time and effort.
3. On-Chain Data: Blockchain data presents a unique opportunity for data engineers to curate high-quality data. Whether it's connecting directly to the blockchain or utilizing alternative data providers, our team specializes in simplifying data usability. We understand the consistent demand for well-curated decentralized finance (DeFi) data and the emerging need for curated data in other domains, including social data. Count on us to provide you with curated on-chain data that empowers your projects.
