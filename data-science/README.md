Ocean Protocol is built to serve the data science space. This guide links you to the most important tutorials for data scientists working with Ocean Protocol.&#x20;



**Core Components for Data Scientists:**

* [Ocean data NFTs ](../developers/contracts/data-nfts.md)and [datatokens](../developers/contracts/datatokens.md) are core building blocks of Ocean Protocol. They allow individuals and businesses to define their ownership of their assets, and create flexible access control tokens
* Ocean's [Compute-to-Data](../developers/compute-to-data/) engine resolves the trade-off between the benefits of open data and data privacy risks. Using the engine, algorithms can be run on data without exposing the underlying data. Now, data can be widely shared and monetized without&#x20;
* [Ocean.py](../developers/ocean.py/) a python library that interacts with all Ocean contracts and tools. To get started with the library, check out our guides. They will teach installation and set-up and several popular workflows such as[ publishing an asset](../developers/ocean.py/publish-flow.md) and starting a [compute job](../developers/ocean.py/compute-flow.md).
