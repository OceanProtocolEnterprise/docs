# What is Data Farming?

**Data Farming (DF) is Ocean's incentive program.** It rewards OCEAN to participants who make predictions (and more streams to come).

**[The DF webapp](https://df.oceandao.org)** is where users perform most DF actions.

 
## DF Streams & Budgets

DF currently has one stream: 

- **[Predictoor DF](predictoordf.md).** Run prediction bots to earn continuously. 37.5K OCEAN/week.

All streams and substreams repeat **weekly** that start on Thursdays 00:00 at UTC and end on Wed at 23:59 UTC.

**[Claiming rewards](claim-rewards.md)**. You can claim rewards each Thursday, or wait and claim many weeks' of rewards at once.

Streams can -- and do -- evolve over time. It's chronicled [here](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45).

## Future Streams

We plan to scale up Predictoor DF rewards over time, especially as it hits development milestones. See [Ocean 2024 roadmap](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2024-e463bf855b03), sec 2.2.

Other potential DF incentives include for running Unified Backend nodes (roadmap, sec 3.2), and for decentralized large-scale model training to support a world model on ground-truth physics (roadmap, sec 2.2).

## Networks

To engage in Predictoor DF, users submit Predictions on Oasis Sapphire.

Rewards for Predictoor DF are on Oasis Sapphire as well (it's intertwined).

The [networks docs](../discover/networks/README.md) have more info about networks.
