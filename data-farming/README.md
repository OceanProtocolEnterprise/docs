# What is Data Farming?

**Data Farming (DF) is Ocean's incentive program.** It rewards OCEAN to participants who lock [OCEAN](https://oceanprotocol.com/about-us/ocean-token) into [veOCEAN](veocean-passivedf.md), curate data, and make predictions -- all in the name of driving **data consume volume** (DCV).

DF is like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for DCV.

Users do most DF actions via the **[DF Webapp](https://df.oceandao.org)**.

**There is 150,000 OCEAN / week available for DF rewards.** In time, this will increase to over 1.1M OCEAN / week. [Here](ocean-reward-schedule.md) are details.

## DF Streams & Budgets

**DF's main streams are Passive DF and Active DF.** The former allows for passive earning potential, and the latter requires more engagement. Each has 50% of the DF budget.

Here are the streams and substreams. The links lead to dedicated pages.

1. **[Passive DF](veocean-passivedf.md).** 75,000 OCEAN per week. Lock OCEAN for veOCEAN; rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.
1. **Active DF.** 75,000 OCEAN per week. It has these substreams:
   1. **[Volume DF](volumedf.md).** Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, ie "curate data". Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.
   1. **[Challenge DF](challengedf.md).** Predict future ETH price, one-time weekly. Rewards are a function of accuracy. Runs from DF48 — DF65.
   1. **[Predictoor DF](predictoordf.md).** Run prediction bots to earn continuously. Starts on DF62.

All streams and substreams repeat on a **weekly** basis that start on Thursdays 00:00 at UTC and end on Wed at 23:59 UTC.

**Claiming rewards.** You can **[claim rewards](claim-rewards.md)** each Thursday, or wait and claim many weeks' of rewards at once.

**Yields.** Typical reward APYs are 5–20%, but may be as high as 45% and as low as 1%. APYs will vary week to week. APY depends on total OCEAN staked, duration of OCEAN lock, DCV, what DF streams you participate in, and other factors. [Learn more here](apys.md).

Active DF's substreams can -- and do -- evolve over time. It's chronicled [here](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45).
