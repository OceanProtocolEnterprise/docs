## What is Data Farming?

Data Farming (DF) is Ocean's incentive program. It rewards OCEAN to participants who lock OCEAN and who help to drive data consume volume (DCV).

DF is like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for DCV.

### Reward Schedule

DF currently rewards 150K OCEAN per week. That will increase to over 1.1M OCEAN per week. Details are [here](ocean-reward-schedule.md)

### DF Streams

DF's main streams are Passive DF and Active DF. The former allows for passive earning potential, and the latter requires more engagement. Each has 50% of the DF budget. Active DF has several sub-streams.

Here are the streams and substreams. The links lead to dedicated pages.

1. **[Passive DF](veocean-passivedf.md).** 75K OCEAN per week. Lock OCEAN for veOCEAN; rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.
1. **Active DF.** 75K OCEAN per week. It has these substreams:
  1. **[Volume DF](volumedf.md).** Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, ie "curate data". Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.
  1. **[Challenge DF](challengedf.md).** Predict future ETH price, one-time weekly. Rewards are a function of accuracy. Runs from DF48 — DF65.
  1. **[Predictoor DF](predictoordf.md).** Run prediction bots to earn continuously. Starts on DF62.

Active DF's substreams can -- and do -- evolve over time.

All streams and substreams repeat on a **weekly** basis that start on Thursdays 00:00 at UTC and end on Wed at 23:59 UTC.

### Getting your $

**Claiming.**. Learn how claim rewards [here](claim-rewards.md)

**[Emissions & APYs](emissions-apys.md)**. OCEAN emissions lead to rewards and therefore participant yields. Typical APYs are 5–20%, but may be as high as 45% and as low as 1%. APYs will vary week to week. APY depends on total OCEAN staked, duration of OCEAN lock, DCV, what DF streams you participate in, and other factors.
