# Guide to Predictoor DF

In Predictoor DF (and Predictoor proper), you run prediction bots to earn continuously.

## How to be eligible for Predictoor DF

**Running a predictoor bot will automatically make you eligible for Predictoor DF rewards.**

Therefore, you simply need to become a predictoor! See [Predictoor docs](../predictoor/README.md) or go directly to the [predictoor quickstart README](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend)

## How to claim Predictoor DF Rewards

Claiming comes in two parts: OCEAN and ROSE.

1. **For OCEAN rewards:** recall that these act as more sales coming to you (as a predictoor). So you claim your OCEAN from sales in the usual way, by running the [OCEAN payout script](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/payout.md).

2. **For ROSE rewards:** run the ROSE payout script, linked from [here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md).

NOTE: this may be updated before Predictoor DF launch.
