# Guide to Predictoor DF

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/gif/money-robot.gif" alt=""></figure>

In Predictoor DF (and Predictoor proper), you run prediction bots to earn continuously. This guide describes how to become eligible for OCEAN rewards and claim them; and the same for Oasis ROSE rewards. And of course first thing you need to do is become a predictoor.

## How to become a predictoor

- Play with the dapp: http://predictoor.ai
- Then follow [Predictoor usage guide](../predictoor/pdr-earn.md)
- Or, go straight to the [quickstart README](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md) :) üèéÔ∏è

## On OCEAN Rewards in Predictoor DF

- **Duration:** ongoing
- **To be eligible:** predictoors are automatically eligible üßò
- **To claim:** recall that the OCEAN rewards act as more sales coming to you (as a predictoor). So you claim your OCEAN from sales in the usual way, by running the [OCEAN payout script](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/payout.md).


## On ROSE rewards in Predictoor DF

- **Duration:** Runs 4 DF rounds - DF62, DF63, DF64, DF65. Limited time!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **To be eligible** for a given DF round: you MUST run [OCEAN payout script](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/payout.md) <= 4 days after the round ends, i.e. between Thu 00:00 UTC & Sun 11:59 PM UTC
- **To claim:** (we will update these instructions once the software is ready)
