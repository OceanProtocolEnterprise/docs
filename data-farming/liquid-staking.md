### veOCEAN is not Tradeable

Once you lock OCEAN, you get veOCEAN.

Unlike OCEAN, veOCEAN cannot be traded or transferred.

However, you can [delegate](delegate.md) veOCEAN to others, who then controls allocation to data assets and receives rewards.

psdnOCEAN offers interesting optionality; see next section.

### psdnOCEAN Liquid Staking

While you can't trade veOCEAN, **you can trade psdnOCEAN.**

**psdnOCEAN is a "liquid staking wrapper" for veOCEAN:**
- It holds veOCEAN
- And it allows transfers (using ERC20 interface)

psdnOCEAN is a product by [H2O](https://www.h2odata.xyz//), a team separate from - and collaborating with - the Ocean core team.

### How to convert OCEAN <> psdnOCEAN

- You can lock OCEAN for psdnOCEAN via [the H2O "convert" dapp](https://liquid-staking.h2odata.xyz/convert/ocean).
- psdnOCEAN can be traded in exchanges. The main option is the [OCEAN-psdnOCEAN Balancer pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/swap?outputCurrency=0x51Fa2efd62ee56a493f24AE963eAce7D0051929E). [Here are pool details.](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xf8c4cd95c7496cb7c8d97202cf7e5b8da2204c2b00020000000000000000039e). ⚠️Be careful - if liquidity is low you will experience high slippage.

### Rewards to psdnOCEAN holders
- Since psdnOCEAN holds veOCEAN, then Passive DF rewards go to that psdnOCEAN-held veOCEAN according to the usual Passive DF rules.
- Over time, psdnOCEAN may also get rewards from other DF streams or protocols too.
