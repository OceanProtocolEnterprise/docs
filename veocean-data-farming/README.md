# veOCEAN & Data Farming

veOCEAN is a fork of veCRV, and enables you to become a governance participant, eligible to receive rewards and engage with different protocol mechanisms.

The following docs should provide you with sufficient intuition to access, utilize, and build upon the protocol's core incentive and reward system: Data Farming.

## veOCEAN

Learning about [veOCEAN](veocean.md) will help you answer the question `"What can I do with my veOCEAN?"` and give you insights on how to access the reward programs.

It will teach you everything you need to know about why it exists and how it works.

## Data Farming

[Data Farming 101](df-intro.md) will teach you about the different reward systems, how they work, and how to access them. You will become proficient and understand them in detail.

[Data Farming Background](df-background.md) will provide you with more intuitions about Data Farming, the Reward Function, and the evolution of the program over time.

## Further Reading

Finally, if you want to continue expanding your knowledge on OCEAN token emissions, APY studies, and specific formulas on key numbers that are reported, you can read the following sections:

[Emissions & APYs](emissions-apys.md) will provide you will information about how OCEAN will be released over time through the Data Farming program and provide you with APY studies.

[Contracts & Formulas](contracts-formulas.md) guides you to where the contracts are deployed, and will break down every number in our ecosystem and how they are calculated.
