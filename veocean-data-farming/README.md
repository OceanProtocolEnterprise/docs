# veOCEAN & Data Farming

veOCEAN is a fork of veCRV, and enables you to become a governance participant, eligible to receive rewards and engage with different protocol mechanisms.

The following docs should provide you with sufficient intuition to access, utilize, and build upon the protocol's core incentive and reward system: Data Farming.

## veOCEAN

Learning about [veOCEAN](veocean.md) will help you answer the question "What can I do with my veOCEAN?" and give you insights on how veOCEAN works. It will teach you everything you need to know about why it exists and how it works.

You will learn that by just holding veOCEAN passively, you are able to earn rewards.

## Data Farming

[Data Farming 101](df-intro.md) will teach you about the different reward systems, how they work, and how to access them. By the end of it, you should be more familiar with how Data Farming works and able to take next steps to curate assets.

[Data Farming Background](df-background.md) will provide you with more intuitions about Data Farming, briefly explain the Reward Function, and how the program evolved over time.

## Further Reading

Finally, if you want to continue expanding your knowledge on OCEAN token emissions, APY estimates, and get useful answers to some of the most common questions, you can read the following:

[Emissions & APYs](emissions-apys.md) will provide you will information about how OCEAN will be released over time through the Data Farming program and provide you with APY studies.

Our [FAQ](faq.md) answers many different questions about staking, chains, deployments, and other details that may be valuable to you.
