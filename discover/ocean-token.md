# The ASI Token

On [March 26th](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/fetch-ai-ocean-protocol-and-singularitynet-unite-to-create-artificial-superintelligence-alliance-0768d608ecfa), Ocean Protocol, SingularityNET, and [Fetch.ai](http://fetch.ai/) joined forces to form the Superintelligence Alliance and announced a strategic merger of their tokens—OCEAN, FET, and AGIX—into a single unified token called “ASI.” The primary vision behind this Alliance is to empower individuals with the freedom to own and control their data and AI, while upholding each person’s autonomy and sovereignty in the emerging AI-driven economy.

Starting with FET as the base token of the Alliance, the FET token will be renamed ASI, with an additional 1.48 Billion tokens minted: 867 million ASI allocated to AGIX holders and 611 million ASI allocated to OCEAN token holders. The total supply of ASI tokens will be 2.63 Billion tokens.

If you are holding OCEAN tokens on the Ethereum network, then you can participate in the Phase 1 migration to FET [here](https://singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi).
