## The OCEAN Token 

The Ocean Token (OCEAN) was the utility token powering the Ocean Protocol ecosystem, used for staking, governance, and purchasing data services, enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized data exchange and monetization.

# The ASI Token

In Late March, Ocean Protocol joined forces with Singularity NET & Fetch.ai to form the superintelligence alliance & announced a token merger Combining OCEAN, FET & AGIX into a single "ASI". The main vision behind the alliance is to give people the freedom of choice to own and control their data and AI, & respect each personâ€™s autonomy and sovereignty in the upcoming AI economy.

Starting with FET as the base token of the Alliance, the FET token will be renamed ASI, and an additional 1.48 Billion tokens will be minted, with 867 million ASI allocated to AGIX holders and 611 million ASI allocated to OCEAN token holders. The total supply of ASI tokens will be 2.63 Billion tokens.

If you are holding OCEAN tokens on the Ethereum network, then you can participate in the Phase 1 migration to FET [here](https://singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi).
