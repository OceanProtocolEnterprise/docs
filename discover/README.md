# ðŸŒŠ Discover Ocean

Ocean's mission is to level the playing field for AI and data.

How? **By helping _you_ monetize AI models and data, while preserving privacy.**

Ocean is a decentralized data exchange protocol. Its core tech is:
- Data NFTs & datatokens: an on-ramp and off-ramp for data assets into DeFi. MetaMask is now a data wallet; Gnosis Safe a data DAO.
- Compute-to-data: buy & sell private data, while preserving privacy

**Ocean users are:**
- **[Developers](../developers/README.md).** Build token-gated AI dApps & REST APIs
- **[Data scientists](../data-scientists/README.md).** Earn via predictions & challenges
- **[OCEAN holders](../data-farming/README.md).** Get rewards by locking OCEAN & curating data, via Data Farming.
- **[Ocean ambassadors](https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/community)**
