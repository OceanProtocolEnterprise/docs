### What builders can do

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Build Your Token-gated AI dApp</mark></summary>

Monetize by making your dApp token-gated. Users no longer have to use credit cards or manage OAuth credentials. Rather, they buy & spend ERC20 datatokens to access your dApp content.

Go further yet: rather than storing user profile data on your centralized server -- which exposes you to liability --  have it on-chain encrypted by the user's wallet, and just-in-time decrypt for the app.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:purple;">Build Your Token-gated REST API</mark></summary>

Focus on the backend: make a Web3-native REST API. Like the token-gated dApps, consumers of the REST API buy access with crypto, not credit cards.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:orange;">Build Your Data Market</mark><br><br></summary>

You have two options:

1. **[Fork Ocean Market**](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market) **and customize it**: Start with the existing [Ocean Marketplace](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market) codebase and customize it. This allows you to leverage the foundational infrastructure and functionality already built by Ocean Protocol while tailoring the user interface, features, and branding to align with your marketplace vision. Follow this [tutorial](../developers/build-a-marketplace/) to learn how to do it.
2. **Build from Ocean components**: In this fashion, you'll be creating a custom data market experience while leveraging the Ocean stack.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Use Ocean in Python</mark><br><br></summary>

The **[ocean.py](../data-scientists/ocean.py/README.md)** library is built for the key environment of data scientists: Python. Use it to earn $ from your data, share your data, get more data from others, and see provenance of data usage.

</details>


<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Do crypto price predictions</mark><br><br></summary>

With [Ocean Predictoor](../predictoor/README.md), you submit predictions for the future price of BTC, ETH etc, and earn. The more accurate your predictions, the more $ you can earn.

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Compete in a Data Challenge</mark><br><br></summary>

Ocean regularly offer [data science challenges](../data-scientists/join-a-data-challenge) on real-world problems. Showcase your skills, and earn $ prizes.

### What OCEAN holders can do

### Become an Ocean Ambassador
