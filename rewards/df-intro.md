# Data Farming 101 (White Belt)

### What is Data Farming?

Data Farming (DF) is Ocean Protocol's **incentive system for curating and publishing valuable assets in the Ocean ecosystem.** Participants vote on the Ocean ecosystem assets that they believe are high quality and likely to sell. If they are right, then these Data Farmers **get a portion of the sales of these Ocean ecosystem assets** they voted on!

(If you are familiar with 'liquidity mining', then you will find that Data Farming is similar but tuned instead for the curation of high quality assets in the Ocean ecosystem.)

### What's the difference between Data Farming and Yield Farming?

Unlike yield farming in DeFi, data farming has real intrinsic utility for Ocean Protocol stakeholders: as Data Farmers determine which are the highest quality assets in the Ocean ecosystem to purchase, then the Data Farmers earn active OCEAN rewards when these assets sell. It's this **curation of the "best" assets in the Ocean ecosystem** that shortens the search times for those looking to shop for assets in the Ocean ecosystem. We also put in place an incentive system for Publishers of assets to gain **2x the rewards** in Data Farming, thus driving forward the addition of great assets in the Ocean ecosystem.

### Passive and Active Rewards

Every week OCEAN rewards are paid out to Data Farmers in two different ways: **passive** rewards and **active** rewards. The two reward functions produce different variable APYs.

#### What are Passive Rewards?

Passive rewards are the OCEAN rewards paid to Data Farmers just for locking their OCEAN tokens.

#### What are Active Rewards and Substreams?

Active Rewards are OCEAN rewards paid to contributors actively working to improve Ocean Protocol. To better reflect this, there are are multiple reward substreams avaialble:
1. Volume DF
2. Challenge DF

Volume DF rewards Data Farmers that allocate their veOCEAN tokens to Ocean ecosystem assets. It's called Volume DF because the amount of rewards relies on Data Farmers allocating veOCEAN to assets that are actively generating Data Consume Volume. Therefore, **Volume DF yields depend on the allocations made and sales produced by these assets.** No sales = no rewards, so choose your favorite datasets wisely & then allocate. Always DYOR.

Challenge DF rewards Data Scientists that produce prediction models that consistently improve the prediction of the price of Ethereum. It's called Challenge DF because weekly rewards are dispensed towards participants that are competing to improve the accuracy of how well we can predict price movements of Ethereum. Therefore, **Challenge DF yields depend on participants accurately outcompeting each other.** Only the top 3 predictions on the leaderboard win.

Active Rewards are governed and defined by the [Reward Function](df-max-out-yield.md#reward-schedule).

#### Splitting the Pie

Each Data Farming weekly round has a pool of OCEAN rewards and [can be viewed here](https://df.oceandao.org/rewards)

##### Reward Streams

50% of the pool is paid out in the form of **Passive Rewards**.  
50% of the pool is paid out in the form of **Active Rewards**.  

| Passive Rewards | Active Rewards |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| 50%             | 50%            |

##### Reward Sub-Streams
**Active Rewards** is then composed of two sub-streams.

1. 5,000 OCEAN is paid out to Challenge DF.
2. The remainder is paid out to Volume DF.  

| Challenge DF | Volume DF |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| 5,000 OCEAN     | Remaining OCEAN    |

### What are Publisher Rewards?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/gif/just-publish.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Publishing lets you earn *more* OCEAN rewards</p></figcaption></figure>

Data Farming strongly incentivizes publishing assets in the Ocean ecosystem by doubling the allocation power of Data Farmers that support their own published assets.

How is it calculated? _All the veOCEAN a Data Farmer has allocated to an asset they‚Äôve published **is effectively doubled for the rewards calculation.**_
