# ðŸ’° Rewards

### Why did we create the Data Farming dApp?

The purpose of Ocean Protocol's Data Farming dApp reward system is to incentivize the curation and publishing of high-quality data NFTs on the Ocean Market. Data Farming participants earn OCEAN rewards for these activities. At a minimum, Data Farmers earn "passive rewards" for locking their OCEAN tokens to get veOCEAN tokens in return. Then, Data Farmers can maximize their yield by earning "active rewards" using their veOCEAN tokens. Active rewards are generated by participants voting on their favorite Ocean Market NFTs by allocating their veOCEAN to these assets, thus gaining a portion of these asset sales.

### The belt system

Earn your white, blue, purple, brown, and black belts in Data Farming knowledge by reading our docs on this topic in increasing difficulty!

## veOCEAN

Learning about [veOCEAN](veocean.md) will help you answer the question "What is the purpose of holding veOCEAN?" & give insights on how veOCEAN (vote-escrowed OCEAN) works. It will teach you everything you need to know about why it exists and how it works.

You will learn that by just holding veOCEAN passively, you are able to rewards.

veOCEAN is a fork of veCRV. This enables participants to become a governance delegate, and eligible to receive rewards and engage with different protocol mechanisms.

## Data Farming

![DF Rewards Page](../.gitbook/assets/rewards/df\_rewards\_page.png)

[Data Farming 101](df-intro.md) introduces the different reward systems, how they work, and how to access them. By the end of the page, you should be more familiar with how Data Farming works and able to take next steps to curate assets.

[Data Farming Background](df-background.md) will provide you with more intuitions about Data Farming, briefly explain the Reward Function, and how the program evolved over time.

## Further Reading

Finally, if you want to continue expanding your knowledge on OCEAN token emissions, APY estimates, and get useful answers to some of the most common questions, you can read the following:

[Emissions & APYs](emissions-apys.md) will provide you will information about how OCEAN will be released over time through the Data Farming program and provide you with APY studies.

Our [FAQ](../discover/faq.md) answers many different questions about staking, chains, deployments, and other details that may be valuable to you.
