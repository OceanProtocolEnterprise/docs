# Welcome to Data Farming

Why did we create Data Farming?

The purpose of Ocean Protocol's Data Farming incentive programs is to onboard participants onto the protocol, and provide them with the tools needed for the growth, curation, and publishing of high-quality data NFTs in the Ocean Ecosystem.  

Data Farming participants earn OCEAN rewards across 2 main streams **Passive Rewards** and **Active Rewards**.  

## Introduction

[Farming 101](df-intro.md) introduces Data Farming, the different reward systems, how they work, and how to access them. By the end of the document, you should feel more familiar with Data Farming concepts and confident to take next steps towards estimating APYs, locking your OCEAN, and accessing other reward streams.

## veOCEAN

Learning about [veOCEAN](df-veocean.md) will help you answer the question "What is the purpose of veOCEAN?" and give insights on how veOCEAN (vote-escrowed OCEAN) works.

Before making any decisions, we recommed you reading up on [how to estimate APY](../user-guides/data-farming/how-to-estimate-apy.md) and putting together plan for locking up your veOCEAN.

### Passive Rewards

At a minimum, Data Farmers earn [Passive Rewards](df-intro.md#what-are-passive-rewards) for locking their $OCEAN and receiving $veOCEAN in return.

### Active Rewards

For participants that are more engaged and want to increase their yield, the [Active Rewards](df-intro.md#what-are-active-rewards) stream is broken down into multiple substreams. This offers contributors a variety of ways to help Ocean Protocol grow and increase your Data Farming rewards: Volume DF, Challenge DF.  

#### Curate Data with Volume DF

In the Volume DF substream, curators can maximize their yield by participating in [Volume DF](df-volumedf.md).

Volume DF requires participants to curate quality datasets that are driving sales and are helping Ocean Protocol achieve traction.

## Delegate Curation

[Delegation](..user-guides/data-farming/how-to-farm-delegate.md) will teach you how to share your veOCEAN allocation power to other users that can help manage Volume DF substream for you.

Once delegated, rewards will be sent to the wallet address you delegated to. The delegation receiver is in charge of managing your Allocation Power and cut from the rewards.

#### Predict with Challenge DF

In this substream, Data Scientists can maximize their yield by participating in [Challenge DF](df-challengedf.md).

Challenge DF requires participants to submit algorithms that predict the price of ETH correctly in order to win rewards.

## Further Reading

Finally, if you want to continue expanding your knowledge on OCEAN token emissions, APY estimates, and get useful answers to some of the most common questions, you can read the following:

[Emissions & APYs](df-emissions-apys.md) will provide you will information about how OCEAN will be released over time through the Data Farming program and provide you with APY studies.

[Data Farming Background](df-emissions-apys.md#a-brief-history-of-data-farming) will provide you with a lot more information about Data Farming, how the program evolved, and explain detailed mechanisms of the program such as the Reward Function.

Our [FAQ](../discover/faq.md) answers many different questions about staking, chains, deployments, and other details that may be valuable to you.
