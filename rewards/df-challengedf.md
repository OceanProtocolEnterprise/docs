## Get extra rewards by competing in prediction challenges!

If you're eager to consume data and create valuable assets for publishing but unsure of where to begin, fear not! We've got you covered.

Data Farming offers rewards to data scientists who participate in weekly challenges. We provide the rules and rewards, allowing you to focus on delivering high-quality results. With challenges taking place on a weekly basis, there's always an opportunity for you to join in, so you're never too late to get started.

### What are the base rules?
